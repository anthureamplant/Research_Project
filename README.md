# Overview Of Project 
The **Anthurium Smart Monitoring System** is a technology-driven solution designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize the growth conditions of Anthurium plants.
The system integrates sensor data, data visualization, and intelligent decision support to improve plant health, productivity, and sustainability.

This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional cultivation practices and modern smart agriculture using IoT and web-based technologies.

# System Architecture
The system consists of:
- **Sensors Layer** – Collects environmental data
- **Processing Layer** – Data validation and analysis
- **Backend Services** – Data storage and APIs
- **Frontend Application** – User interface and visualization
# Other dependents 
**Frontend**
- React.js (JSX)
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend**
- Node.js / Express (if applicable)

**Database**
- MongoDB / Firebase / MySQL (configurable)

**Hardware (Optional)**
